# Introduction

I'm Soc Virnyl Estela (aka **_uncomfyhalomacro_**). I like to discuss about
Linux, Wayland, and various programming languages such as Julia, and Rust.

I'm a package maintainer for the [openSUSE](https://get.opensuse.org)
community, mostly Wayland and Rust software.

My main background is biology but I also have exposure to computer science
when I was in high school.

Most of my projects are now hosted either
on [Sourcehut](https://sr.ht/~uncomfy) and
[Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/uncomfyhalomacro).
