software engineering in various fields. I am a proud member of the openSUSE community, where I maintain 22+ packages
that include tools for my organization. I have been involved in open source
software development since 2020, starting with Debian as my first Linux
distribution. I believe in the spirit of open source and its potential to
advance scientific discovery and innovation.

I also post blogs, rants and notes sometimes on [my website](https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl).

just continue learning and hopefully, those experiences will narrow down to
a preferred profession.
