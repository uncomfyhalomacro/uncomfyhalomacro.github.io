### About Me

Hello there,<img src="./me.png" style="width:130px;border: solid black 1px;border-radius:360px;float:left;margin-right:10px;margin-top:10px;">
</img>I am **Soc Virnyl Estela**, also known by the tech community as _uncomfy_ or _uncomfyhalomacro_.
I've been a self-taught developer since 2019. It started with a very slow laptop
that I needed to finish my thesis. So my solution to that was to install Debian
Linux and everything changed.
I finished my undergraduate in Biology (Major in Microbiology) in 2022 and
worked as a college instructor until 2024. During those years, I self-learned
and contributed to the [openSUSE Community](https://opensuse.org) as a packager
and open-source developer.

Luckily, I was able to shift my career to tech as a technical writer since 2024
until 2025. I then worked as an early career software developer for 4 months where I built
projects in Rust, Golang and Python.
