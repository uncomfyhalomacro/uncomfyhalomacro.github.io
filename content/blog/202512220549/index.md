Hi. I haven't done any monthly updates for quite sometime. Although, I did
promise to myself to do some monthly updates, I also realised that sometimes
there is nothing to say that is interesting.

As for what happened in those months, I got employed as a *junior software
developer*. It was very exciting as it was my first time writing software to be
used in production. It was also the first time building a system that my
colleague refer to as *data engineering* as we have to process data and
transform it into some form we can use for our consumers. It was also the first
time I was able to write multiple Rust projects (and a Go project) for message
processing.

At first, I thought I will do anything crazy to learn asynchronous programming.

Surprisingly, it was manageable and I have grasped some concepts by imagining a system
based of my readings on the Erlang OTP's design and principles -
<https://erlang.org/download/armstrong_thesis_2003.pdf>. And also with my biology background,
it also helped me understand what a system looks like if everything is running concurrently
and maybe in parallel at the same time.

Not saying I am an expert yet but what I have learnt helped me create these projects.

But what amazed me this year is that, it was also my first time writing an API in Rust
with OpenAPI docs, similar to FastAPI's OpenAPI docs generation. You have to try
[utoipa](https://docs.rs/utoipa/latest/utoipa/) with [axum](https://docs.rs/crate/axum/).

I plan to write some tutorial in the future for how to utilise these two crates in building APIs
as it was really difficult for me the first time to understand how utoipa is being used with
web frameworks like axum.

As for life happenings, my physical and mental health has recovered with the
exception that I have stopped working out for the past few months. I resume next
year and set a schedule but I still need to find a gym or place to do so for
some personal reasons.

I also have bought some games in Steam such as
[Dispatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispatch_(video_game)) and [Metro
Exodus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Exodus).  I already played the
former and have yet to play the latter. Dispatch really is a cool interactive
story. Hoping for their second installment of the series!

I also have made some cool friends in the open source community in the Philippines. I'll visit them soon!

And lastly, my main game now is *Mobile Legends Bang Bang*. As much as I used to dislike the game before because
of my opinions on game balancing, I just played it because it was fun in its own way.

That's all for my updates for this year. And I hope everyone's 2026 is a blast as well! 🎉

**Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year** 🥳
