Hey! If you noticed the similarities between <https://emersion.fr/>'s blog,
that's because I really liked his format. Thanks Simon Ser.

This month's update is about my projects, [obs-service-cargo][obs-real],
[roast][roast], and [obs-service-cargo-vendor-home-registry][obs-v2]. I will
just combine what happened last month.

[obs-service-cargo-vendor-home-registry][obs-v2] was an attempt to use the
`$CARGO_HOME` registry cache as vendored source. Now, it was archived
since the code was merged over to [obs-service-cargo][obs-real].

And yes, I did a whole rewrite of [obs-service-cargo][obs-real] before doing that[^r].
The only issue now is that `cargo-fetch` does not cache for platforms because
of [this](https://github.com/openSUSE-Rust/obs-service-cargo/issues/114) and
[this](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/14116).

[roast][roast] is basically functionally complete. The next plan is to create a
Rust equivalent of [obs-service-scm](https://github.com/openSUSE/obs-service-tar_scm),
with roast.

That's all for this short monthly update! Most of my time now is learning [deno](https://deno.com)
and building Typescript projects with deno. See you next month!


[obs-real]: https://github.com/openSUSE-Rust/obs-service-cargo
[roast]: https://github.com/openSUSE-Rust/roast
[obs-v2]: https://github.com/openSUSE-Rust/obs-service-cargo-vendor-home-registry

[^r]: [roast][roast] was part of this rewrite since some of its code came from [obs-service-cargo][obs-real].
