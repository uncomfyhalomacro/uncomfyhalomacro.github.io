So here I am doing another attempt at updating a package in openSUSE. This package is [biome](https://biomejs.dev). As of writing,
it's way behind 1 minor version, and still at version 2.0.5.

# Preparing to fork and clone

The first thing I did was login to <https://src.opensuse.org> with my openSUSE account.

![openSUSE OpenID](./wayshot-2025_07_20-19_26_47.png)

![openSUSE Login portal](./wayshot-2025_07_20-19_30_13.png)

Once logged in, I headed to <https://src.opensuse.org/javascript/biome>.

![openSUSE Gitea Biome Repository](./wayshot-2025_07_20-19_32_27.png)

I clicked the fork button on the upper-right and cloned the repository to inside a local directory, in this case,
mine is located at `~/development/git-obs/` since this kind of workflow does not really require a "root"
OBS directory e.g. `~/development/obs` where it contains directories to projects such as my home project
`home:uncomfyhalomacro` that contains packages or subprojects.

![Running git clone of the forked repo](./wayshot-2025_07_20-19_37_30.png)

# Updating the sources

I deleted the sources first with the following commands:

```bash
cd biome  # heading into the git repository
git rm *.tar*  # deleting the sources
```

FYI, I accidentally ran `osc rm *.tar*` at first because I was still stuck with the mindset using the old workflow.

![Oopsie with the command](./wayshot-2025_07_20-19_40_16.png)

The latest version as of writing is now at 2.1.2 or specifically, at the git tag `@biomejs/biome@2.1.2`. Seems they use a
different naming scheme for tagging versions but it's still 2.1.2. No worries because the `Source0` points to
the archive of the same naming scheme.

![Naming scheme in SOURCE0](./wayshot-2025_07_20-19_43_21.png)

Then I ran the following command.

```bash
osc service -vvv mr
```

![Command output for osc service -vvv mr](./wayshot-2025_07_20-19_46_26.png)

As you can see from the image above, biome has a lot of crate dependencies.

This command produced two new tarballs, `biome-2.1.2.tar.gz` and a refreshed `vendor.tar.zst`.

# Updating the changes file

I ran the following command to update the `biome.changes` file.

```bash
osc vc
```

However, this makes this a manual process because there is no perfect way to get all changelogs. Hence,
I have to clone the upstream biome repository on GitHub.

![Cloning upstream repo](./wayshot-2025_07_20-19_56_39.png)

Then ran the following commands to get each commit summary between 2.0.5 and 2.1.2.

```bash
git log @biomejs/biome@2.0.5..@biomejs/biome@2.1.2 --oneline | cut -d' ' -f2- | wl-copy
```

![new changes file](./wayshot-2025_07_20-20_05_01.png)

# Commiting and pushing the changes

Then I committed those changes after adding the updated files and removing the old sources.

![commit image](./wayshot-2025_07_20-20_06_58.png)

I ran `git push`. Remember that this operation should have Git LFS enabled.

# Setting the meta project and meta package

At this point, if I was sure that this will build correctly, I can just open a PR to <https://src.opensuse.org/javascript/biome>.

However, just for showing how I set a meta project and a meta package, I ran the following commands.

```bash
osc meta prj -e home:uncomfyhalomacro:biomejs
```

The XML file configuration for this meta project is this.

```xml
<project name="home:uncomfyhalomacro:biomejs">

  <title></title> <!-- Short title of NewProject -->
  <description></description>
    <!-- This is for a longer description of the purpose of the project -->

  <!-- Uncomment and specify an URL and branch if your project is managed in git.
  <scmsync>url#branch</scmsync>
  -->

  <person role="maintainer" userid="uncomfyhalomacro" />
  <person role="bugowner" userid="uncomfyhalomacro" />
<!-- remove this block to publish your packages on the mirrors -->
  <publish>
    <disable />
  </publish>
  <build>
    <enable />
  </build>
  <debuginfo>
    <enable />
  </debuginfo>


  <repository name="openSUSE_Factory">
    <path project="openSUSE:Factory" repository="snapshot" />
    <arch>x86_64</arch>
    <arch>i586</arch>
  </repository>

</project>
```

Take **note** that I did not set scmsync option for this because I don't need to or I have not learned to set a git project as a meta project's scmsync option yet.

For package setup, I pointed it to the new meta project and then added a suffix `/biome` to create a package biome.

```bash
osc meta pkg -e home:uncomfyhalomacro:biomejs/biome
```

Sadly, I am not too fluent with how the XML configuration works. So I just passed this one instead

```xml
<package name="biome">

  <title></title> <!-- Title of package -->

  <description></description> <!-- for long description -->

  <scmsync>https://src.opensuse.org/uncomfyhalomacro/biome#main</scmsync>

<!-- following roles are inherited from the parent project
  <person role="maintainer" userid="uncomfyhalomacro"/>
  <person role="bugowner" userid="uncomfyhalomacro"/>
-->
<!--
  <url>PUT_UPSTREAM_URL_HERE</url>
-->

<!--
  use one of the examples below to disable building of this package
  on a certain architecture, in a certain repository,
  or a combination thereof:

  <disable repository="SUSE_SLE-10"/>
  <disable repository="SUSE_SLE-10" arch="x86_64"/>

  Possible sections where you can use the tags above:
  <build>
  </build>
  <debuginfo>
  </debuginfo>
  <publish>
  </publish>
  <useforbuild>
  </useforbuild>

  Please have a look at:
  http://en.opensuse.org/Restricted_formats
  Packages containing formats listed there are NOT allowed to
  be packaged in the openSUSE Buildservice and will be deleted!

-->

</package>
```

Notice the scmsync option. I pointed it to my fork and with the branch "main".

Fortunately, the meta project has the correct config for setting which images to use for the build workers.

![Package is building](./wayshot-2025_07_20-20_19_25.png)

For clarity, the full link to the build after setting the meta project and meta package is <https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:uncomfyhalomacro:biomejs/biome>. You may not be able to access this in the future because
I probably deleted the meta project.

I waited for the builds to succeed.

![Building status](./wayshot-2025_07_20-20_22_51.png)

One of the builds succeeded after a while.

# Making a PR

Lastly, I created a PR from my fork to the javascript project

![PR to project](./wayshot-2025_07_20-20_31_15.png)

The **autogits-devel** bot will stage my changes (with the **autogits_obs_staging_bot**) and creates a new meta project for testing my PR.

It basically just did what I did in the last steps where I created a meta project and meta package and check if the builds succeed.

![Auto gits devel bot](./wayshot-2025_07_20-20_32_50.png)

![Auto gits obs staging bot comment](./wayshot-2025_07_20-20_36_15.png)

![New meta project and package generated from staging bot](./wayshot-2025_07_20-20_37_00.png)

Once the builds succeed, my changes are then merged.

The merge message should look similar to the one I had for **rusty_v8** (see image below).

# Conclusion

~~At this point, I am not familiar how those changes are pushed into Factory~~. I believe there will be an automation as well
for pushing devel packages from devel projects to Factory. I also believe that the <https://opensuse.github.io/scm-staging/user_guide.html> is
deprecated or inaccurate because of this experience.

In conclusion, I guess this is how far I can understand how the SCMSync workflow works. If you have any questions, just
[email me](mailto:uncomfyhalomacro@opensuse.org) or message me in [openSUSE Discord](https://discord.gg/opensuse).

# Updated Last Stepâ€“SR a devel project to Factory

Avindra, one of the packagers, messaged me on Discord and that there is a part I missed. To submit a devel project
to Factory, one can just do the same thing as mentioned in <https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:OBS_to_Git#How_to_submit_from_devel_project_to_Factory?>.

Hence, for biome, it would be just

```bash
osc sr devel:languages:javascript/biome openSUSE:Factory
```

But when I did this, the rev is suspicious and also there was no changelog. I aborted because I then discovered that
the meta package is still building for RISCv64. It's still building after I slept for 8 hours... ðŸ¤£

Thus, I SR-ed for rusty_v8. I will SR for deno too after a few days to let the snapshot have rusty_v8. ðŸ™‚
