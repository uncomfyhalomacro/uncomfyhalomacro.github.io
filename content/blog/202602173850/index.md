Hi there. I am actually running for openSUSE's board membership.

_And the reality is... I don't know what it's like to run or lead a community._ 😅

# So why?

The community is growing. With multiple derivatives, I think it's time that we
need to find new stewards of the community. I am not really sure where to start on this
as, honestly, my only pressing concern is that who are going to replace the _oldies_[^oldies]?

Jokes aside, the openSUSE community is growing but as a community grows, there is also
another pressing problem if the current structure of governance can keep up.

# Am I capable to be a board member? What even is a board member?

The short answer is _I don't know_. The other short answer is _no_.

I am not really sure if I can commit to it either. What I do know is my
passion for the community.

A board member in openSUSE is to lead the overall project in different areas
and that includes moderating conflicts, revising rules, and promoting inclusivity.

It may also include initiatives like new projects or conferences and partnerships.

With that said, I don't think there really is much to say to change a board member's
role in the community.

# Regarding the proposed changes on Governance

This thread -> <https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/project@lists.opensuse.org/thread/YKI5QVMT66WMZLOPTCQOEQZPTEWPDIBV/>
contains the proposed governance structure for the openSUSE community. It's a lot so you have to read it
again and again. Took me days to get to it but I have an idea of what was being proposed.

The proposal is intended to add _new committees_ instead of having just the
board members pivoting the project. If I can understand correctly, this is meant
to invite more contributors and allow to diversify the functions and goals of
the project as well as ensuring that the community is involved. By adding new
committees, new independent bodies and members will take initiative on how to steer the
project in specific areas. Here is a copy of the proposed committees and their roles:

> * Introducing a Technical Steering Committee to provide technical
> direction and arbitration when consensus fails
> * Introducing a Community & Marketing Committee focused on community
> growth, communication spaces, and outreach


After I read until the end, there really is nothing much that has changed but
just an additional specificity that the project needs so new contributors are
not burdened by confusion. Autonomy is preserved and at least the community now
has a clearer way to contribute back without the need to understand the full
history of the project.

# Overall opinion about the new governance

Like Bernhard said, it is well formulated.

> Although, our views might be different so *well formulated* might be a
different part of the proposal or the overall proposal itself.

Because in my opinion, the new governance structure allows that the power to steer the project
is for the community, by the community, to the world.

# Closing thoughts and concerns

My only concern now is I have no history of being involved in discussions, especially as a newcomer
and from Asia and no experience in being a steward of a community. But that's something I'll know
once

# Answering the bonus question

I'll be honest, the dates are overlapping with my family's celebration plan for my sister's medschool
graduation so there is a chance that I am not able to attend oSC2026. Maybe I can attend the openSUSE.Asia Summit
which was proposed to be hosted in Indonesia, a neighbour country. I am excited to attend. Hopefully, I'll get
employed by then and save enough to get there (_currently unemployed as of writing_ 🥀🥀🥀🥀🥀)


[^oldies]: Old people 50+yrs oldies. Although, there really is a bit of truth to it that I think we might need to have younger members...
