So recently, I noticed that I have a lot of emails about some build problems in openSUSE, specifically,
the [Julia](https://julialang.org) package. I attempted to package this software for openSUSE in hopes that
I can help out bring the programming language to the Linux distribution. However, it was kind of hairy,
not to mention, a lot of workarounds... like a lot â€” imagine you have to patch and create a lot of patches
for the patches to patch the patches.

So I have ignored it for a very long while, thinking that I can do it in the future. But as of writing?
I gave up. It's a tiresome software to package, and it is incompatible most of the time with OpenBuildService's
policies.

But if you still want to use Julia in openSUSE, you can always use the [juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup)
package. It is a version multiplexer for Julia similar to [rustup](https://rustup.rs). Just run the following
command on your terminal if you are using openSUSE.

```bash
sudo zypper install juliaup
```

Nothing much I can say further as this is just a small update. Bye!
