Hello! It's time for another status update!

December was quite uneventful. I really took a break from learning software
development (not entirely but like I lessened my interaction with it).

For tech related stuff, I have fully migrated
[roast](https://codeberg.org/Rusty-Geckos/roast) from GitHub to
[Codeberg](https://codeberg.org). The reason? For a long time, I want
to start slowly migrating away from GitHub for my open-source projects. I
want to inspire or advocate that it is possible to foster a community and
contribute with no big tech corporation managing our code with questionable
decisions and copyright issues.

Other than that, roast's development has come to a pause. I plan to write
an equivalent

[Otap](https://codeberg.org/Rusty-Geckos/otap) is still on-pause for a
year. But I really plan to resume its development starting 2025 alongside
roast.

For [rypper](https://codeberg.org/Rusty-Geckos/rypper/), that is still in
my mind. I hope that once otap is done, I will go back to rypper and start
working on it full-time. I really plan to make it a zypper alternative,
and if better, a zypper replacement.

Merry Christmas ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ„ and see you all again next year where I will
be learning assembly, C, Elixir, Zig, Go, and Gleam to increase my knowledge
in computer programming! ðŸŽ‰
