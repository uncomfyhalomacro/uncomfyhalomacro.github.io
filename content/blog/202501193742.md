Hello again! And a very late new year I guess??? That was 20 days ago as of
writing ü•¥

For this month's update, there is nothing much technical going on, no
project updates and no project progress. I've been taking a break from
software development like I always do every year's January. Although, I do
make exceptions on some days but this January is zero progress. I will
be back on February for more updates on my personal projects. For now,
I am more focused on trying to socialise and my personal health as of
the moment.

As for my personal life happenings, I've been geared to focus on my physical
health to get back in shape. I am quite surprised I am still *somewhat*
in shape despite my lack of physical exercise a few years ago. I plan to at
least make a 3-day walk+sprint, each have at least 6km of distance to cover.
I did it in two days, consecutively. But I was not able to do it on a third
day because it seems there was an imminent downpour. But I will resume
tomorrow as of writing.

That's all for this month's update! And yes, I will be voting for the
openSUSE Board elections for this month. üôè
