Hello! Another monthly update!

[roast][roast_v6] has finally released v6.1.1 including a new featureâ€”**roast
scm**. As explained in the project's `README.md`:

> roast_scm is an extended utility of roast. Its purpose is to create
> tarballs from a remote repository. The behaviour is similar to roast but
> only at some point.

Development still continues in this [branch][scm_improvements]
as I plan to make it an alternative or a replacement of
<https://github.com/openSUSE/obs-service-tar_scm/>.

After all that is implemented, I plan to incorporate
it to [obs-service-cargo][obs-cargo] in this
[PR](https://github.com/openSUSE-Rust/obs-service-cargo/pull/124).

The next project I am planning to resume is [otap][otap] but that would require me
to read the codebase again as I haven't touched it for a very long time.

Next month, you'll probably see more updates.

That's all for May's updates!
