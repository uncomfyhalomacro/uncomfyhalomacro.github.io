Hello there,

I haven't written in a while. I was busy touching grass.

As for tech updates, I have figured out or at least I have some sample code for
an additional feature for [roast](https://codeberg.org/Rusty-Geckos/roast). It
is a feature to create tarballs from remote git repositories. Currently,
it is still on-pause even though I believe I can write the feature in a
day. Kind of burnt out lately, hence, I am engaging in casual dating and
friendships online, which I don't usually do. I just followed my friend's
suggestion. He is quite supportive. Thanks my man if you ever read this.

That's all for the update. I hope I will continue to write more updates but
this burnt out feeling is hindering my ability to. I'll probably hit to the gym
after writing this.
