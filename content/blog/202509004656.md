Not really sure what to write on this blog. But for this month's status
update, I don't really have much anything going except volunteer stuff
in <https://ossph.org> and <https://opensuse.org>.

There are lots of things going on actually and I can't really be bothered
to type them all.

So I am going to write them in bullet points:

- Finally got `devel:languages:zig` approved in openSUSE Build Service. This is to
experiment on how we package [Zig](https://ziglang.org) in openSUSE (and to fix
other issues such as packages that are still stuck in a Zig version).
- Resuming [boot.dev](https://boot.dev) course. I need to understand
how cloud storage works (but it seems to be straightforward... security side of things though i
something I am looking towards into).
- Reviving <https://ossph.org>. The org now plans to revive the community
by introducing more activities such as talks, workshops or meetups. For
now we are doing meetups and increasing engagement in the Discord community.
- Got a MacBook Air M2. I might have gone for an M3 or M4 but I can't be bothered
since the machine exceeded my expectations. I am writing this post currently
on my MBA. Maybe I will give this to my sister once I had more money as she currently struggles
with her MBA M1 (broken kind of keyboard).
- Realising that the effort to do something should be compensated with better
opportunities. And that energy is reciprocated at the same level.
- I need to think of solutions to help out the Filipino community. So far, none.


Well, that's all for this monthly update.
