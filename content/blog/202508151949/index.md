Hello there! I skipped a lot of months because I don't have anything to write actually
and I was busy improving my skills and learning [Go](https://go.dev) at [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev).


I was also focused on improving my Resume/CV to land a job. Hopefully, it will be a stable
full-time job.

So what happened within those few months before August?

In June 26, I joined [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev) to improve my skills and relearn
fundamentals. There, I revisited Python, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Go.

In July 18, I participated [Boot.dev 2025 Hackathon](https://blog.boot.dev/news/hackathon-2025/) and won **first place**
in their amateur category. I am not sure really if I should have participated in the Pro category but I have
not worked as a software developer before, but only as a **technical writer**. My project, [bunny](https://github.com/uncomfyhalomacro/bunny)
is a markdown parser library written in [**Harelang**](https://harelang.org) that won in hackathon.

I don't have any other new projects as of the moment but I plan to finish the Golang backend course
from Boot.dev.

Oh yeah, I am still looking for a job, so if you have read this, and find that I fit for a role or believe
that I can do it, please contact me!

Bye!
