what i believe to be love—was just me painting a picture
that does not hold any water

if only life was a little bit kind,\
but what i get was the harsh reality—\
that one mistake is enough

a mistake that could have been fixed,\
but no one reached out—\
to reassure me that "to err is human"

i was willing,\
determined,\
to fix myself,\
to prove for them,\
that i also deserve to be understood,\
but here i am,\
trying to heal up,\
while gasping for air

i hope someday,\
i'll be able to swim back to the shore,\
but now, i am still in this life raft—\
thinking what to do next

may time give me the peace i need
