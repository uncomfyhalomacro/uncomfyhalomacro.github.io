I am actually running for openSUSE's board membership.<p><em>And the reality is... I don't know what it's like to run or lead a community.</em> 😅<h1 id=so-why>So why?<a aria-label="Anchor link for: so-why" class=zola-anchor href=#so-why>§</a></h1><p>The community is growing. With multiple derivatives, I think it's time that we need to find new stewards of the community. I am not really sure where to start on this as, honestly, my only pressing concern is that who are going to replace the <em>oldies</em><sup class=footnote-reference id=fr-oldies-1><a href=#fn-oldies>1</a></sup>?<p>Jokes aside, the openSUSE community is growing but as a community grows, there is also another pressing problem if the current structure of governance can keep up.<h1 id=am-i-capable-to-be-a-board-member-what-even-is-a-board-member>Am I capable to be a board member? What even is a board member?<a aria-label="Anchor link for: am-i-capable-to-be-a-board-member-what-even-is-a-board-member" class=zola-anchor href=#am-i-capable-to-be-a-board-member-what-even-is-a-board-member>§</a></h1><p>The short answer is <em>I don't know</em>. The other short answer is <em>no</em>.<p>I am not really sure if I can commit to it either. What I do know is my passion for the community.<p>A board member in openSUSE is to lead the overall project in different areas and that includes moderating conflicts, revising rules, and promoting inclusivity.<p>It may also include initiatives like new projects or conferences and partnerships.<p>With that said, I don't think there really is much to say to change a board member's role in the community.<h1 id=regarding-the-proposed-changes-on-governance>Regarding the proposed changes on Governance<a aria-label="Anchor link for: regarding-the-proposed-changes-on-governance" class=zola-anchor href=#regarding-the-proposed-changes-on-governance>§</a></h1><p>This thread -> <a href=https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/project@lists.opensuse.org/thread/YKI5QVMT66WMZLOPTCQOEQZPTEWPDIBV/ rel=external>https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/project@lists.opensuse.org/thread/YKI5QVMT66WMZLOPTCQOEQZPTEWPDIBV/</a> contains the proposed governance structure for the openSUSE community. It's a lot so you have to read it again and again. Took me days to get to it but I have an idea of what was being proposed.<p>The proposal is intended to add <em>new committees</em> instead of having just the board members pivoting the project. If I can understand correctly, this is meant to invite more contributors and allow to diversify the functions and goals of the project as well as ensuring that the community is involved. By adding new committees, new independent bodies and members will take initiative on how to steer the project in specific areas. Here is a copy of the proposed committees and their roles:<blockquote><ul><li>Introducing a Technical Steering Committee to provide technical direction and arbitration when consensus fails<li>Introducing a Community & Marketing Committee focused on community growth, communication spaces, and outreach</ul></blockquote><p>After I read until the end, there really is nothing much that has changed but just an additional specificity that the project needs so new contributors are not burdened by confusion. Autonomy is preserved and at least the community now has a clearer way to contribute back without the need to understand the full history of the project.<h1 id=overall-opinion-about-the-new-governance>Overall opinion about the new governance<a aria-label="Anchor link for: overall-opinion-about-the-new-governance" class=zola-anchor href=#overall-opinion-about-the-new-governance>§</a></h1><p>Like Bernhard said, it is well formulated.<blockquote><p>Although, our views might be different so <em>well formulated</em> might be a different part of the proposal or the overall proposal itself.</blockquote><p>Because in my opinion, the new governance structure allows that the power to steer the project is for the community, by the community, to the world.<h1 id=closing-thoughts-and-concerns>Closing thoughts and concerns<a aria-label="Anchor link for: closing-thoughts-and-concerns" class=zola-anchor href=#closing-thoughts-and-concerns>§</a></h1><p>My only concern now is I have no history of being involved in discussions, especially as a newcomer and from Asia and no experience in being a steward of a community. But that's something I'll know once I am elected.<h1 id=answering-the-bonus-question>Answering the bonus question<a aria-label="Anchor link for: answering-the-bonus-question" class=zola-anchor href=#answering-the-bonus-question>§</a></h1><p>I'll be honest, the dates are overlapping with my family's celebration plan for my sister's medschool graduation so there is a chance that I am not able to attend oSC2026. Maybe I can attend the openSUSE.Asia Summit which was proposed to be hosted in Indonesia, a neighbour country. I am excited to attend. Hopefully, I'll get employed by then and save enough to get there (<em>currently unemployed as of writing</em> 🥀🥀🥀🥀🥀)<section class=footnotes><ol class=footnotes-list><li id=fn-oldies><p>Old people 50+yrs oldies.
