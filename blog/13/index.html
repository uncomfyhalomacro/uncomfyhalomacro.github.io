MicroOS has some of it's perks but the current state of the operating system is still in it's beta/alpha state so some moving parts are inherently broken. It's probably because of the lack of contributors and interest from SUSE and openSUSE for the desktop variant of MicroOS. As much as I want to become a contributor, I realize I lack the time to do so because of work and personal problems and issues I still have to fix a lot in real life. If you still want to know how I use it, continue reading.<hr><p>MicroOS Desktop is a <em>desktop variant</em> of the openSUSE's MicroOS for servers and containerized workflows. Please do note, although they are similar, they are separate products and have different goals.<blockquote><p>Issues in MicroOS for server should be issued over there and issues in MicroOS Desktop should be on MicroOS Desktop.</blockquote><p>The goal of the desktop is as follows:<ul><li>immutability<li>isolation of system and user software<li>containerized workflows</ul><h2 id=immutability>Immutability<a aria-label="Anchor link for: immutability" class=zola-anchor href=#immutability>§</a></h2><p>Immutable desktops are nothing new. Windows and MacOS are immutable desktops since <em>you cannot change the core part of the system</em> unless you have some permissions and workarounds to do it e.g. modifying the system registry. For years, this was the standard of modern OSses including Android.<p>Traditional desktop linux and nix systems are <em>mutable</em> which means that the user can modify each part of the core system. Although this advantage is also a disadvantage, nothing is perfect.<h3 id=advantages-of-an-immutable-system>Advantages of an immutable system<a aria-label="Anchor link for: advantages-of-an-immutable-system" class=zola-anchor href=#advantages-of-an-immutable-system>§</a></h3><p>Being immutable is inherently an advantage of an immutable desktop system. It is hard to modify the core part of the system and updates are "atomic" which means the whole system will update as an immutable system.<p>Users are encouraged to use workflows through sandboxing or containers. In this case, <strong>flatpaks</strong>, <strong>nix</strong>, <strong>distrobox</strong>, <strong>toolbx</strong>, <strong>docker</strong> and <strong>podman</strong>.<p>For desktop software, it is advisable to use flatpaks. <em>Some users do use toolbx and distrobox for this</em>.<p>For development environment, they are encouraged to use distrobox and toolbx. Others may prefer nix.<h3 id=disadvantages>Disadvantages<a aria-label="Anchor link for: disadvantages" class=zola-anchor href=#disadvantages>§</a></h3><p>Being immutable <em><strong>may</strong></em> also be a disadvantage. It's very self-explanatory. You cannot modify your system as much as you like to.<h3 id=security>Security<a aria-label="Anchor link for: security" class=zola-anchor href=#security>§</a></h3><p>Immutable desktops increases security of the core system since it's not welcoming any modifications. Since the root file system is read-only, it's not easy to tamper the system and thus, users can avoid any vulnerabilities <em><strong>unless the vulnerability is from the package and software installed from the root file system</strong></em>.<h2 id=my-workflow>My Workflow<a aria-label="Anchor link for: my-workflow" class=zola-anchor href=#my-workflow>§</a></h2><p>For software that I want to use e.g. Firefox, flatpaks are the way to go. Flatpaks are the best when it comes to these kind of distributions as they are self-contained and do not pollute the host system with ridiculously brittle and large dependencies when installing through the system's package manager.<p>For developing and packaging software and also for learning, and note taking, I use distrobox.<h3 id=how-i-use-distrobox>How I use distrobox<a aria-label="Anchor link for: how-i-use-distrobox" class=zola-anchor href=#how-i-use-distrobox>§</a></h3><p>I created <code>mainbox</code> executable.<pre style="color-scheme:light dark;color:light-dark(#3c3836,#ebdbb2);background-color:light-dark(#f9f5d7,#1d2021)" class=giallo><code data-lang=shellscript><span class=giallo-l><span style=color:light-dark(#928374,#928374);font-style:italic>#!</span><span style=color:light-dark(#928374,#928374);font-style:italic>/usr/bin/bash</span></span>

I also set the <code>--home</code> flag when creating this podman container. The <code>--home</code> flag helps you have a custom <code>$HOME</code> inside your container. It avoids clutter on your <em>actual home directory</em>.<h1 id=conclusion>Conclusion<a aria-label="Anchor link for: conclusion" class=zola-anchor href=#conclusion>§</a></h1><p>For now, I am still new to MicroOS Desktop and I still experience some bugs here and there because I use the KDE Plasma variant of MicroOS which is known to be still in it's <strong>alpha</strong> stage. This means, it's not yet considered for daily use <em>even though some users are now using it</em>. To help improve the experience, it's best to file bug reports and propose suggestions to the MicroOS Plasma Desktop maintainers and contributors. If you are privileged to have the free time to contribute, consider offering your skills and services as well.<h1 id=troubleshooting>Troubleshooting<a aria-label="Anchor link for: troubleshooting" class=zola-anchor href=#troubleshooting>§</a></h1><h2 id=blurry-fonts-on-kde-plasma>Blurry fonts on KDE Plasma<a aria-label="Anchor link for: blurry-fonts-on-kde-plasma" class=zola-anchor href=#blurry-fonts-on-kde-plasma>§</a></h2><p>Install all the <code>xdg-desktop-portal</code> implementations especially gnome and gtk. Blurry fonts are usually affecting gtk apps and not qt apps.<h1 id=issues>Issues<a aria-label="Anchor link for: issues" class=zola-anchor href=#issues>§</a></h1><p>NVIDIA drivers don't load as fast causing some issues with the login manager. Workarounds is a force <code>systemctl restart display-manager.service</code>. I am not sure what's causing it as there are no logs. This does not happen on vanilla openSUSE TumbleWeed.</section></article></div><section class=webring><h3>Articles from blogs I follow around the net</h3><section class=articles><div class=article><h4 class=title dir=auto><a href=https://ryanaque.com/wfd/should-date-created rel=noopener target=_blank>[WFD 33] this blog site needs a date created</a></h4><p class=summary dir=auto>only last updated matters according to WFD 16. but mass-updating timestamps when i change a shared admonition makes every WFD look freshly written.</p><small class=source> via <a href=https://ryanaque.com/>Ryana May Que — Writings for Discussion</a></small><small class=date>February 28, 2026</small></div><div class=article><h4 class=title dir=auto><a href=https://soatok.blog/2026/02/25/cryptography-engineering-has-an-intrinsic-duty-of-care/ rel=noopener target=_blank>Cryptography Engineering Has An Intrinsic Duty of Care</a></h4><p class=summary dir=auto>To understand my point, I need to first explain three different cryptography attack papers / blog posts.
