        <content type="html" xml:base="https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/blog/202505110154/">&lt;p&gt;Also called the Git workflow, I am quite confused of how the process works.
There is a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opensuse.github.io&#x2F;scm-staging&#x2F;user_guide.html&quot;&gt;guide&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
and even following it, I am more confused than before since there are missing
pieces and information about this workflow even though each step looks &quot;straight-forward&quot;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I don&#x27;t have issues if this new git workflow was communicated well
to volunteers and packagers, alike. I actually see potential in it but I
also see potential problems with it assuming this will become the main
workflow in the future.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the lack of information on what Git config to have. When I tried it for the
first time, Git LFS needs to be enabled. What&#x27;s interesting is Git LFS by nature is slow
as indexing and tracking large files can really slow down uploads and downloads of
package sources. As a volunteer living in the Philippines, in a city with at least
&quot;okay-ish&quot; internet, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;it took me at least 30 minutes&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; to download the LFS &quot;objects&quot; for the
vendored tarball for rusty v8.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, after I was able to push the Git sources to my fork, I performed a PR but
here are other things that got me confused.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are two git branches, &lt;code&gt;devel&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; vs &lt;code&gt;factory&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; in
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;src.opensuse.org&#x2F;javascript&#x2F;rusty_v8&quot;&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;src.opensuse.org&#x2F;javascript&#x2F;rusty_v8&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As mentioned in the guide, you have to make a PR to the &lt;code&gt;factory&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;
branch. But isn&#x27;t the point of &lt;code&gt;devel&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; in the old workflow to attempt building
the project before pushing it to Factory as part of the checks?&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;scm-staging-bot&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; was not present even after the PR was approved.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, there should be some form of CI but maybe the build runs on OBS
through the &lt;strong&gt;scm-staging-bot&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; 😕. But there was none present.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new workflow is such a blocker because, for example, as of writing,
there is a need to update &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;denoland&#x2F;deno&#x2F;&quot;&gt;deno&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; as
mentioned in &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugzilla.suse.com&#x2F;show_bug.cgi?id=1244070#c4&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
Knowing that, I also searched and found that there were some that
shared my frustration or confusion with the move to git workflow in
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugzilla.suse.com&#x2F;show_bug.cgi?id=1244110#c4&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, this is still a developing issue, so I might update this post
after some things are cleared up? Yeah...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/blog/202504093310/">&lt;p&gt;Hello there,&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&#x27;t written in a while. I was busy touching grass.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for tech updates, I have figured out or at least I have some sample code for
an additional feature for &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codeberg.org&#x2F;Rusty-Geckos&#x2F;roast&quot;&gt;roast&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It
is a feature to create tarballs from remote git repositories. Currently,
it is still on-pause even though I believe I can write the feature in a
day. Kind of burnt out lately, hence, I am engaging in casual dating and
friendships online, which I don&#x27;t usually do. I just followed my friend&#x27;s
suggestion. He is quite supportive. Thanks my man if you ever read this.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#x27;s all for the update. I hope I will continue to write more updates but
this burnt out feeling is hindering my ability to. I&#x27;ll probably hit to the gym
after writing this.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/blog/i-will-say-this-again-science-is-not-an-issue-intent-is/">&lt;p&gt;As a child, I was always into the field of science. Always curious, always
wanting to explore things to find an answer to all my questions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now as an adult, that intensity is now a small candle rather than a roaring
flame. It is not because I do not love science anymore. But it is because
of how the world changed a lot. Or to be more accurate, I have finally
noticed what the real world is like. Living as a child was living in a bliss
of ignorance.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Priorities change when you become an adult. Fortunately, science is always
progressing, and technology is always innovating and that brings excitement
or disappointment not because science and technology is a bad thing. But
because science can be also used for nefarious purposes. That&#x27;s not new.
I already know that. I am just not happy with the state of the world right now.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my generation, of whom are born around the year 1990s and 2000s,
we have finally reached the peak of &lt;strong&gt;enshittification&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.  From our
internet and social networks, to the full-blown browser trackers
or spyware and advertisements that do not even make sense at all,
to the low-quality service and the not-stealing-stealing from many
subscription based media companies — we can see the world is now full of
nightmare-cocaine-fuel-dopamine-addicting-technology-to-false-science things.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/blog/change-of-plans-and-priorities/">&lt;p&gt;As my selection of what to learn grows, I think there will be a change of
plans and priorities. It&#x27;s time to narrow down what is essential.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, I am learning Rust, and will do some Go. This added more and more of
my to-do list of learning things.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;and-it-became-unproductive&quot;&gt;And it became unproductive&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#and-it-became-unproductive&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: and-it-became-unproductive&quot;
  &gt;§&lt;&#x2F;a
&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My attention span on learning stuff were getting lower and lower to a point,
I need to reassess which and which are not to learn.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the list of things I need to do&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting aside System Administration&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting aside Kanidm&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting aside Crystal&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They&#x27;re really not set aside. I can go back to them in the future if I have the time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;crystal-is-good-why-not-keep-it&quot;&gt;Crystal is good, why not keep it?&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#crystal-is-good-why-not-keep-it&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: crystal-is-good-why-not-keep-it&quot;
  &gt;§&lt;&#x2F;a
&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, only a few companies I know use Crystal. 😥 Even though it&#x27;s actually a more
useful language to learn and can replace Go.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;now-what-should-i-learn&quot;&gt;Now what should I learn&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#now-what-should-i-learn&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: now-what-should-i-learn&quot;
  &gt;§&lt;&#x2F;a
&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust will always stay. Erlang will stay. Go is added. Python will be revisited. And one database?
I&#x27;m planning to at least learn one but never got the chance to. Possibly, Postgres or MySQL.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-erlang&quot;&gt;Why Erlang?&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#why-erlang&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: why-erlang&quot;
  &gt;§&lt;&#x2F;a
&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concurrency. Also, some of Go&#x27;s ideas are taken from Erlang so I also need to check those as well.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-python&quot;&gt;Why Python?&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#why-python&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: why-python&quot;
  &gt;§&lt;&#x2F;a
&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s not hard to relearn. I just need to revisit it. It&#x27;s good for scripts and prototyping.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-rust&quot;&gt;Why Rust?&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#why-rust&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: why-rust&quot;
  &gt;§&lt;&#x2F;a
&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because blazingly 🚀🚀🚀 fast 😜&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-now&quot;&gt;What now?&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-now&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-now&quot;
  &gt;§&lt;&#x2F;a
&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. I am going to watch Learn Go in 3 hours from a Humble Bundle I got last year. And then
read Thorsten Ball&#x27;s Writing an Interpreter in Go. I will check out Erlang&#x27;s language reference
too ☺️&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
